$N.n.n

# == This ⤴︎ is the version number of this repository. == #
#
# Just the version number string, no other characters. All
# other instances of "a version number" must match Line 1
# of this file.
#
# When starting a "release" or "hotfix" branch and you must
# "increment version numbers", start with the above, then
# check below for more locations.
#
# When a "release"/"hotfix" branch is finished, the version
# number in the 'vN.n.n' tag should match this.


# == Numbering Scheme & Method == #
#
# (default)
#  * Method: manual
#
# (default)
#  * Scheme: [SemVer](http://semver.org/)
#
# This may be different depending on the project. If we
# can't use SemVer here, then specify the version-numbering
# details here.


# == Other File Locations == #
#
# These are the other locations where this version number is
# defined in this project:
#
# (default for a theme project)
#  * style.css
#
# (default for a plugin project's)
#  * the-plugin-name.php
#
# (default for a WordPress website project)
#  * wp-content/site-specific-child-theme/style.css
#  * wp-content/site-specific-plugin/site-specific-plugin.php
#
# (if this is the only location)
#  * none
#
# When "incrementing version numbers" on this project, the
# version numbers in these files must be updated to match,
# either by hand or by build script.
